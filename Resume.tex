\section{Experience}
 {\bf University of Wisconsin-Madison,} Dept. of Computer Sciences \\
Research Assistant (Computer Vision)\hfill {\it May 2013 - present}
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Designed a novel algorithm for denoising images using multiple views.
 \item Used CUDA C to make this highly parallel algorithm run 4 times faster than other known multiple view denoising algorithms. 
 \end{itemize}

  {\bf University of Wisconsin-Madison,} Dept. of Botany \\
Project Assistant\hfill {\it Sept 2012 - Aug 2013}
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Developed a tool in MATLAB for tracking texture on hypocotyls for analysis of plant growth. The tool is published on iPlant Collaborative to for botanists world-wide who study plant growth.
 \end{itemize}
  {\bf Scicom Software India Pvt. Ltd.} \\
Project Intern\hfill{\it Aug 2011 - July 2012}
 \begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
 \item Designed and developed a simulator software for a control system using C\#. This reduced the time-to-market by 33\% and earned a new project for the organization.
 \item Worked with a team in design of hardware for the control system. Reduced product cost by 25\% of the budget. Followed German safety standards. 
 \item End-to-end development of a video inspection software using C++ and DirectShow.
 \end{itemize}
\section{Projects}
{\it Real-time 3D Reconstruction using Kinect:} Performed bilateral filtering on depth map. Rendered implicit surfaces using Signed Distance Function. {\it(OpenCL, GPU, C\#, Kinect)}
\\{\it MoshBall:} Developed a 3D game. Developed physics simulation, I/O interaction and background rendering for the game. {\it (C++, OpenGL, GLSL, Box2D)}  
\\{\it Panoramic Image Stitching:} Registered and stitched together eighteen images into a $360\,^{\circ}$ panorama. {\it (MATLAB, SIFT)}
\\{\it Music Recommendation System:} Recommended top ten songs to a user using offline collaborative filtering, normalized conditional probabilities and k-NN on the listening history of users. {\it (Java, MySQL)}

\section{Side Projects}
HDR Image Fusion, Photo-metric Stereo, Spam Classification, Othello.
